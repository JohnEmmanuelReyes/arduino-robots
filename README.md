# Arduino Maze Solver
###Code by: Horatiu Lazu, overseen by Richard Dang
###Wiring by: Richard Dang, overseen by Horatiu Lazu

##Purpose:
*Permit a robot to utilize one LDR and traverse through a maze
*Quick algorithm
*Minimal turning radius
*Minimal materials and processing use

##Known bugs:
*If the robot is too long and the turning radius is too large, the robot may skip a line
