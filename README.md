# Arduino Robots

##Maze Solver
The maze solver is a team project that was developed to allow a Arduino robot to traverse a difficult maze using only LDR sensor, and an H-bridge connect to a GearBox. 

###Features/Purpose:
* Permit a robot to utilize one LDR and traverse through a maze
* Quick algorithm
* Minimal turning radius
* Minimal materials and processing use

###Known bugs:
* If the robot is too long and the turning radius is too large, the robot may skip a line

##SumoBot
The SumoBot is a robot that utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect other robots and go towards them. The robot was completed in a team, and was further used as a model when designing the MSEO (Mackenzie Science and Engineering Olympics). 

###Features/Purpose:
* Simple algorithm
* Code design allows for easy use of methods
* Turning mechanism allows wheels to rotate on the spot by reversing a wheel
